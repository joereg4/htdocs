    <p>I've been learning how to create images using generative AI and created a series call Animal Aviators (<a href="https://jregenstein.com/2023/09/05/using-generative-ai-to-create-animal-aviators/">blog post
        here</a>). To get a consistent look and feel required editing generated images and backgrounds which required
        learning photo editing software. With those new skills, I created a series called Yellowstone Sunset in which I
        created the images myself. The Yellowstone series features a gradient background in a silhouette of animals that
        would be found in the National Park featuring a buffalo, wolf and bear along with some other animals. I created
        a Sasquatch version just for fun.  To share the designs, I created a <a href="https://www.riggstees.com/">store</a> which features these designs and more.
